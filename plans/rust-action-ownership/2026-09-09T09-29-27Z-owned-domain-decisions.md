# Task plan

## Interpreted request

Make recursive single responsibility and data locality explicit in Cortex. Compound conditions that repeatedly inspect one authored object's state belong to that object's meaningful domain API. Return named enum or data-bearing decisions so callers orchestrate outcomes without reconstructing policy. Apply this to article blocks and concrete candidates across Rust, browser code, AI tooling and infrastructure while preserving behavior and actual boundary contracts.

## Requirements

- Carry Rust API changes through their WASM and TypeScript consumers.
- Keep unit-test sources consistent with revised APIs and capture meaningful state invariants.
- Preserve cryptography, authorization, wire formats, and secret lifecycle boundaries.
- Deliver one pull request and stop before merge.

## Constraints and exclusions

This snapshot supersedes the earlier typestate plan for workflow scope: remaining work is implementation only. The user has deferred all verification until separate instruction; no formatter checks, lint, source audits, typechecks, compilation, tests, reviews, or validation workflows will be run. Normal source inspection and required fixture calculations remain part of implementing coherent changes. Earlier Rust/browser hygiene was completed before this instruction.

- The user explicitly waived the pull-request addition limit for this mission.
- Do not execute tests or local or GitHub code reviews. Do not dispatch validation suites containing tests.
- Keep authored files within the source-size limit. Do not introduce artificial state machines or generic utility owners.
- Generated and vendored code are not independently rewritten. Agent tooling, executable-skill TypeScript implementations, infrastructure scripts and preflight are included through separately assigned owners. Deployment behavior, infrastructure topology and repository PR-budget policy remain unchanged. Canonical function-ownership/domain-API policy and directly relevant Cortex guidance are included.

## Migration scope

AI owns canonical Cortex policy, article-block decision owners, executable skills and Loom. Development core owns portable Rust decisions and generated consumer projections. Web owns direct consumer migration and real browser state decisions. SRE owns Hive, preflight and infrastructure predicates. Recurse into genuine subowners, preserve untrusted admission, short-circuit/error order, wire schemas, cryptography and secret lifetimes. Keep true host/trait boolean contracts and primitive leaf comparisons at their actual boundary; reject generic boolean wrappers and cosmetic class conversion.

## Initial plan

1. Discover concrete compound domain predicates under each owner through source inspection.
2. Update canonical policy and refactor the cited article block plus related AI-owned decisions.
3. Move Rust domain decisions to knowledgeable owners and migrate affected browser consumers.
4. Apply the same rule to owned browser and infrastructure decisions.
5. Commit and push to PR #1573; publish exact candidate accounting and deferred verification limitations.

## Completion evidence

- Team handoffs identify exact transformed surfaces and any remaining limitations.
- Implementation handoffs and candidate dispositions are recorded without code-verification claims.
- The pull request links this plan and the final worklog.

## Safety review

This record contains no raw prompt, chat transcript, secrets, credentials, private data, raw logs, local paths, internal hostnames, environment values, or unnecessary infrastructure details.
