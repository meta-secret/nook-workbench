# Task plan

## Interpreted request

Replace stringly recovery-code recognition categories with explicit Rust enums. Give observed phrase matching a cohesive lexical owner and carry semantic categories through recognition decisions. Consolidate duplicated recovery vocabulary where behavior is shared. Literal human-language phrases remain only at the lexical input boundary. Preserve existing matching, privacy and classifier behavior.

## Requirements

- Carry Rust API changes through their WASM and TypeScript consumers.
- Keep unit-test sources consistent with revised APIs and capture meaningful state invariants.
- Preserve cryptography, authorization, wire formats, and secret lifecycle boundaries.
- Deliver one pull request and stop before merge.

## Constraints and exclusions

This snapshot supersedes the earlier typestate plan for workflow scope: remaining work is implementation only. The user has deferred all verification until separate instruction; no formatter checks, lint, source audits, typechecks, compilation, tests, reviews, or validation workflows will be run. Normal source inspection and required fixture calculations remain part of implementing coherent changes. Earlier Rust/browser hygiene was completed before this instruction.

- The user explicitly waived the pull-request addition limit for this mission.
- Do not execute tests or local or GitHub code reviews. Do not dispatch validation suites containing tests.
- Keep authored files within the source-size limit. Do not introduce artificial state machines or generic utility owners.
- Generated and vendored code are not independently rewritten. Agent tooling, executable-skill TypeScript implementations, infrastructure scripts and preflight are included through separately assigned owners. Deployment behavior, infrastructure topology, policy Markdown, and the repository PR-budget policy remain unchanged.

## Migration scope

Development core owns the focused recovery-code candidate and authentication observation recognition modules in nook-companion-core, plus necessary direct Rust callers and inline fixture sources. No browser API change is expected. Existing tooling and presentation boundaries remain unchanged.

## Initial plan

1. Trace recovery phrase groups and their semantic decisions.
2. Implement enums and a cohesive lexical owner, replacing stringly domain category flow and duplicated recognition vocabulary.
3. Adapt source examples without running them.
4. Commit and push to PR #1573; publish outcome with all verification still deferred.

## Completion evidence

- Team handoffs identify exact transformed surfaces and any remaining limitations.
- Implementation handoffs and candidate dispositions are recorded without code-verification claims.
- The pull request links this plan and the final worklog.
