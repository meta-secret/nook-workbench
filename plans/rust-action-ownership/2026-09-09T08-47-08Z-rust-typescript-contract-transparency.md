# Task plan

## Interpreted request

Remove unnecessary Rust/WASM-to-TypeScript transformations and duplicate domain shapes so TypeScript consumes canonical Rust-generated structs and enums. Preserve static contract information through adapters instead of casts, generic objects and local mirrors. Strengthen existing generation dependencies where necessary so changed public Rust contracts reach TypeScript checking. Arbitrary internal Rust compiler failures still belong to the Rust build; this work targets shared-contract coupling.

## Requirements

- Carry Rust API changes through their WASM and TypeScript consumers.
- Keep unit-test sources consistent with revised APIs and capture meaningful state invariants.
- Preserve cryptography, authorization, wire formats, and secret lifecycle boundaries.
- Deliver one pull request and stop before merge.

## Constraints and exclusions

This snapshot supersedes the earlier typestate plan for workflow scope: remaining work is implementation only. The user has deferred all verification until separate instruction; no formatter checks, lint, source audits, typechecks, compilation, tests, reviews, or validation workflows will be run. Normal source inspection and required fixture calculations remain part of implementing coherent changes. Earlier Rust/browser hygiene was completed before this instruction.

- The user explicitly waived the pull-request addition limit for this mission.
- Do not execute tests or local or GitHub code reviews. Do not dispatch validation suites containing tests.
- Keep authored files within the source-size limit. Do not introduce artificial state machines or generic utility owners.
- Generated and vendored code are not independently rewritten. Agent tooling, executable-skill TypeScript implementations, infrastructure scripts and preflight are included through separately assigned owners. Deployment behavior, infrastructure topology, policy Markdown, and the repository PR-budget policy remain unchanged.

## Migration scope

Development core owns Rust/WASM generated contracts and transparent DTO boundaries; Web owns direct browser consumers and removal of duplicate types/transformations. SRE owns concrete Hive Rust-to-console contract gaps and existing generation wiring if needed. Preserve wire/storage formats, opaque capability identity/lifetimes, Rust authorization, nullable host boundaries and meaningful presentation conversions. No hand-authored generated declarations, generic bridge framework or weakening of runtime admission.

## Initial plan

1. Trace canonical Rust types through generated boundaries to authored TypeScript consumers and identify contract-erasing mirrors or transformations.
2. Refactor Rust exports/projections to preserve concrete generated types.
3. Replace TypeScript mirrors/casts/transforms with direct canonical type consumption and preserve genuine host/presentation adapters.
4. Address concrete tooling contract dependencies using existing generation infrastructure; remove superseded APIs.
5. Commit and push to PR #1573; document exact coupling and unexecuted generation/compilation limits.

## Completion evidence

- Team handoffs identify exact transformed surfaces and any remaining limitations.
- Implementation handoffs and candidate dispositions are recorded without code-verification claims.
- The pull request links this plan and the final worklog.

## Safety review

This record contains no raw prompt, chat transcript, secrets, credentials, private data, raw logs, local paths, internal hostnames, environment values, or unnecessary infrastructure details.
